OL,6, TheCFriends of the 502 GroupGcame      
OL,7, together from a meeting of like-minded 
OL,8, railway enthusiasts in 2008.           
OL,10, At a meeting with the NRM in July 2008,
OL,11, it was agreed that the two 502 vehicles
OL,12, would be placed on loan to the group.  
OL,14, The next task was to find a new home   
OL,15, for the unit. With the neeed to move   
OL,16, the unit becoming increasingly urgent, 
OL,17, a site was secured on a private site in
OL,18,CTebay,GCumbria.                        
OL,20, The site was less than ideal in many   
OL,21, respects, but the unit was moved there 
OL,22, over the weekend of 28/29 May 2009.

OL,6, We remained at Tebay until March 2012, 
OL,7, when the land on which the unit stood  
OL,8, was let to a commercial organisation.  
OL,9, We were helped on this occasion by the 
OL,10,CMerseyside Transport Trust,Gwho had    
OL,11, just relocated their collection of     
OL,12, heritage buses to Burscough Industrial 
OL,13, Estate. With space to spare in the new 
OL,14, building, the MTT offered us a space.  
OL,16, Over the weekend of 3rd-4th March 2012,
OL,17, the 502 moved to the MTT building. At  
OL,18, Burscough the 502 is now in secure,    
OL,19, undercover storage for the first time  
OL,20, in nearly two decades.

OL,6, In November 2023, the Friends of the   
OL,7, 502 Group reincorporated as a charity, 
OL,8, becoming theCClass 502 Preservation    
OL,9,CTrust.                                 
OL,11, Despite the change of name, the goal of
OL,12, our organisation remains the same: to  
OL,13, preserve the remaining class 502 unit  
OL,14, for future generations to enjoy, and to
OL,15, educate about the history of electric  
OL,16, trains on Merseyside.                  
OL,18, Work has progressed well at Burscough, 
OL,19, with the corroded bodywork on one coach
OL,20, completely replaced, and the interior  
OL,21, renovation now substantially complete.
