OL,6, By 1914, Liverpool's rail network had  
OL,7, already benefited enormously from the  
OL,8, foresight of theCLancashire & Yorkshire
OL,9,CRailway,Gwhich had progressively       
OL,10, electrified its suburban lines from    
OL,11, Liverpool Exchange to Southport and    
OL,12, Ormskirk.                              
OL,14, The electric trains were a significant 
OL,15, improvement over the steam-hauled      
OL,16, carriages they replaced, and passengers
OL,17, were quick to take advantage of the    
OL,18, higher speeds and increased frequency  
OL,19, of the electric service.

OL,6, In 1923, the L&Y was absorbed into the 
OL,7, newCLondon, Midland and Scottish       
OL,8,CRailway (LMS).GLocally there was little
OL,9, immediate change, and by the late 1930s
OL,10, the original electric trains were      
OL,11, looking dated. Passengers grew         
OL,12, increasingly dissatisfied with the     
OL,13, ageing rolling stock, leading to calls 
OL,14, in local newspapers for new trains.    
OL,16, In August 1939, the first of a new     
OL,17, batch of LMS-designed electric multiple
OL,18, Units was delivered to Meols Cop works 
OL,19, for commissioning. Despite the         
OL,20, disruption caused by the outbreak of   
OL,21, war, all units were in service by 1941.

OL,6, The new trains were built using the    
OL,7, most advanced standards of the time.   
OL,8, Notably, they were equipped with       
OL,9, automatic sliding doors, controlled by 
OL,10, the guard, instead of the manually-    
OL,11, operated slamdoors which were still the
OL,12, norm elsewhere on Britain's railways.  
OL,13, Each motor car had four 230hp motors   
OL,14, supplied byCEnglish Electric.          
OL,16, The units had a top speed ofC70mph,    
OL,17, which was easily achieved on the gentle
OL,18, gradients of the Southport and Ormskirk
OL,19, lines. The comforable interiors and    
OL,20, modern design were in stark contrast to
OL,21, the elderly L&Y units they replaced.

OL,6, In 1948 the railways were nationalised,
OL,7, with the LMS being absorbed into the   
OL,8, London Midland region ofCBritish       
OL,9,CRailways.GUnder BR, the units were     
OL,10, designatedCClass 502.                  
OL,12, The post-war years saw a marked decline
OL,13, in the fortunes of the railway, as     
OL,14, competition from cars and other road   
OL,15, transport increased dramatically. In   
OL,16, 1963 Dr Richard Beeching published his 
OL,17, now infamous reportC"The Reshaping of  
OL,18,CBritain's Railways"Gwhich proposed the 
OL,19, closure of 6,000 miles of railway. An  
OL,20, early vicrim of the cuts was the 502-  
OL,21, operated Southport-Crossens shuttle,   
OL,22, which closed in 1964.

OL,6, From 1968, the new rail blue livery was
OL,7, applied to the trains, along with the  
OL,8, now-familiar double arrow symbol. This 
OL,9, was followed in 1971 by the appearances
OL,10, of a new brand name -CMerseyrail.GThis 
OL,11, was the name used by the newly-formed  
OL,12,CMerseyside PTEGfor the servies they    
OL,13, jointly administered in partnership    
OL,14, with BR. It was also the first step    
OL,15, towards the creation of the integrated 
OL,16, rail network that exists on Merseyside 
OL,17, today.                                 
OL,19, During the 1970s, new tunnels were     
OL,20, excavated to connect the ex-L&Y routes 
OL,21, with the formerCMersey RailwayGterminus
OL,22, at Liverpool Central.

OL,6, The final years of the 502s' careers   
OL,7, saw them appeaing on new parts of the  
OL,8, network. From 1977 they appeared at    
OL,9,CKirkby,Gworking over a newly-          
OL,10, electrified part of the Liverpool to   
OL,11, Bolton line, while in 1978 they started
OL,12, operating on another extension to the  
OL,13, network: the formerCCheshire Lines     
OL,14,CCommitteeGroute from Liverpool Central 
OL,15, to Garston. These routes were grouped  
OL,16, together as Merseyrail'sCNorthern Line.
OL,18, The new routes took their toll on the  
OL,19, 502s. The 1-in-30 gradients on the new 
OL,20, lines were steeper than anything the   
OL,21, units had previously encountered.

OL,7, came in 1978, when the first class 507 
OL,8,Gunit was delivered from BREL's York    
OL,9, works. Over the next two years the 502s
OL,10, were progressively withdrawn, the final
OL,11, examples surviving until the end of    
OL,12, September 1980. The last run of all was
OL,13, a farewell tour on 4th October 1980.   
OL,15, The 502s notched up nearly forty years 
OL,16, of service, and in recognition of this,
OL,17, a 2-car set was claimed for

OL,8, for preservation by the National       
OL,9, Railway Museum. As there was a chance

OL,11, placed on extended loan to the         
OL,12, Steamport railway centre in Southport. 
OL,14, The museum's own volunteers, supported 
OL,15, by the Northwest Friends of the NRM,   
OL,16, begain work on restoring the unit. By  
OL,17, the end of 1983 the unit had been      
OL,18, overhauled and rewired.

OL,21, Mersey Railway centenary celebrations, 
OL,22, running between Birkenhead and Hoylake.

OL,9, retired from the main line. It remained
OL,10, on display to Steamport visitors until 
OL,11, 1997, when the museum closed.          
OL,13, With the closure of Steamport, the unit
OL,14, was returned to the National Railway   
OL,15, Museum. There was no space at the NRM's
OL,16, York site for the 502, which instead   
OL,17, was placed into storage atCMoD Kineton.
OL,19, There was no indoor storage available, 
OL,20, and the 502 was open to the elements.  
OL,21, Within a short time, the bodywork began
OL,22, to suffer from corrosion.
