OL,6, The Class 507 Preservation Society was 
OL,7, founded in 2023 by a group of rail     
OL,8, enthusiasts who were keen to see an    
OL,9, example of this class preserved for    
OL,10, posterity. Our committee includes      
OL,11, people from both inside and outside the
OL,12, railway industry, with a wealth of     
OL,13, experience.                            
OL,15, We identified blue and grey "celebrity"
OL,16, unit 507001 as the best candidate for  
OL,17, preservation. This reflected the unit's
OL,18, historic status as the first in service
OL,19, and the train that carried the Queen.  
OL,20, 507001 was expected to be among the    
OL,21, final units withdrawn in summer 2024,  
OL,22, so available to us at the right time.

OL,6, We found a home for the unit at the    
OL,7,CTanat Valley Light RailwayGin Nant Mawr
OL,8, Shropshire.                            
OL,10, The costs of transporting 507001 to its
OL,11, new home by road were expected to be   
OL,12, considerable. So, in the summer of 2024
OL,13, we launched our Crowdfunder, which was 
OL,14, an unprecedented success, reaching its 
OL,15, #10,000 target in less than four weeks.
OL,17, On 23rd January 2025, 507001 left      
OL,18, Birkenhead North depot for the first   
OL,19, time. However, it did not go to the    
OL,20, TVLR immediately, but rather to Derby's
OL,21, Litchurch Lane works, at the invitation
OL,22, of the facility's owner,CAlstom.

OL,6, In August 2025, 507001 was one of the  
OL,7, many exhibits atCThe Greatest Gathering
OL,8, - a unique special event to celebrate  
OL,9, 200 years of the modern railway.       
OL,11, The unit will eventually be moved to   
OL,12, its permanent home at the TVLR. There, 
OL,13, it will be on display and viewable to  
OL,14, the public whenever the site is open.  
OL,15, Inside, we will have information boards
OL,16, telling the story of the unit and the  
OL,17, development of the Merseyrail network. 
OL,19, The unit will be connected to a power  
OL,20, supply to keep its batteries charged   
OL,21, and operate on-board equipment such as 
OL,22, lights, compressors and doors.

OL,6, In the long-term, we are exploring     
OL,7, options for the unit to carry          
OL,8, passengers in the absence of third rail
OL,9, power. This may include modifications  
OL,10, to allow the unit to be hauled by a    
OL,11, locomotice, or the fitting of traction 
OL,12, batteries to allow the unit to move    
OL,13, independently.                         
OL,15, Whatever happens, 507001's future is   
OL,16, assured. We have an example of a train 
OL,17, which served Merseyside for 46 years,  
OL,18, conveying generations of Merseysiders  
OL,19, to work, to school, to days out at the 
OL,20, seaside, to nights out on the town.
